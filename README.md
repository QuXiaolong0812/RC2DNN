# This is the implementation coda for the paper "Relation classification via convolutional deep neural network" by COLING 2014

## !!!ATTENTION!!!
- Rich comments are added to this implementation code, which is very friendly to beginners!
- Running "*pip install -r requirements.txt*" to install the required packages before running the code.
- The pre-trained word embedding file needs to be downloaded separately because it is too large. I provide the Google [Drive download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17nivm3HeRWdy9dRxLsBk_XA1fG1XQhbz/view?usp=sharing) link. After downloading the file, put it in the *embeddings* folder.
